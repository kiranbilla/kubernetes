#Common Errors in #Kubernetes and Tips on #Troubleshooting Them:-

1. Pod Security Policies:
 - Check PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) violations.
 - Adjust PSP or use PodSecurity admission controllers.

2. Kubelet Certificate Rotation:
 - Monitor kubelet certificate expiration.
 - Rotate certificates if needed.

3. Cluster Autoscaler Issues:
 - Verify autoscaler configuration.
 - Check node group scaling policies.

4. ServiceAccount Token Expiration:
 - Ensure service account tokens are not expired.
 - Rotate service account tokens if needed.

5. Scheduler Issues:
 - Inspect scheduler logs for errors.
 - Check for node affinity and anti-affinity issues.

6. Readiness and Liveness Probe Failures:
 - Review pod configurations for probes.
 - Check probe logs and adjust thresholds.

7. Inconsistent API Versions:
 - Verify client and server API versions match.
 - Use compatible kubectl versions.

8. Kube-dns Service Missing:
 - Ensure CoreDNS (or kube-dns) service is running.
 - Validate DNS settings in kubelet configurations.

9. ImageRegistry Authentication:
 - Check image pull secrets in pod specifications.
 - Verify registry credentials.

10. HorizontalPodAutoscaler Not Scaling:
 - Check metrics server and HPA configurations.
 - Inspect HPA events and logs.

11. Pod Affinity/Anti-affinity Issues:
 - Verify pod affinity/anti-affinity rules.
 - Check node labels for affinity.

12. Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) Issues:
 - Validate CRD creation and versions.
 - Check for CRD controller errors.

13. Resource Quotas Exceeded:
 - Review resource quotas with kubectl describe.
 - Adjust quotas or request more resources.

14. RuntimeClass Configuration Issues:
 - Verify RuntimeClass in PodSpec.
 - Check container runtime compatibility.

15. Secrets Decoding Errors:
 - Validate encoded secrets.
 - Ensure proper base64 encoding.

16. Invalid Ingress Controller Configuration:
 - Inspect Ingress controller logs.
 - Verify controller configurations.

17. Pod Priority and Preemption Issues:
 - Check priorityClass in PodSpec.
 - Verify kube-scheduler settings.

18. Node Network Connectivity Issues:
 - Check node network configurations.
 - Verify firewall rules on nodes.

19. Service External IP Not Assigned:
 - Check cloud provider integration.
 - Verify LoadBalancer service configurations.

20. PodSecurityContext Misconfigurations:
 - Validate pod security context settings.
 - Ensure compatibility with node settings.

21. Kubelet Certificate Rotation Issues:
 - Monitor and rotate kubelet certificates.
 - Verify certificate expiration dates.

22. Volume Plugin Not Loaded:
 - Check kubelet logs for volume plugin errors.
 - Verify plugin installation and configuration.

23. NodeDrain Failures:
 - Check node drain status with kubectl drain.
 - Investigate any evicted pods.
