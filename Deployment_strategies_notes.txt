#Deployment strategies in #K8s

In Kubernetes (k8s), there are several deployment strategies you can use to update applications running in cluster. Each strategy has its own use cases, benefits, and trade-offs. Here are the most common deployment strategies in Kubernetes:

1. #Recreate Deployment:

- #Description: Terminates all the old Pods and creates new ones.
- #Use Case: Suitable for non-critical applications where downtime is acceptable.
- #Trade-offs: Simple but results in downtime.

2. #Rolling Update:

- #Description: Gradually replaces old Pods with new ones. Ensures that some instances of the application are always running.
- #Use Case: Default strategy in Kubernetes, suitable for most applications where zero downtime is required.
- #Trade-offs: Takes longer than Recreate but provides continuous availability.

3. #Blue-Green Deployment:

- #Description: Deploys the new version alongside the old version. Once the new version is verified, traffic is switched from the old version to the new one.
- #Use Case: Useful for critical applications where you want a quick rollback mechanism.
- #Trade-offs: Requires double the resources temporarily, as both versions run concurrently.

4. #Canary Deployment:

- #Description: Gradually shifts traffic to the new version by incrementally increasing the number of users who see the new version.
- #Use Case: Suitable for applications where you want to test the new version with a subset of users before full rollout.
- #Trade-offs: More complex to implement but allows for controlled testing and feedback.

5. #A/B Testing:

- #Description: Similar to Canary, but focuses on testing two different versions to see which performs better.
- #Use Case: Useful for feature testing and performance comparison.
- #Trade-offs: Requires detailed monitoring and analysis.

6. #Shadow Deployment:

- #Description: Sends a copy of real user traffic to a new version while keeping the user interaction with the old version. The new version does not affect the actual user experience.
- #Use Case: Useful for testing new features or versions under real user load without affecting the end users.
- #Trade-offs: Increases resource consumption and requires careful traffic management.
